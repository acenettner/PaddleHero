How to play:

A simple paddle game where you try to destroy objects
as they come down the screen with a ball. If the ball
goes past the paddle or the paddle collides with a
non ball object, the game is over. You can hold one
screen wipe, and it gets replenished every 20 points.

Controls:
- Right and Left arrow keys to move
- Space to destroy all objects on screen
- Enter to pause or restart after losing
